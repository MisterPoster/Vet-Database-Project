# Vet-Database-Project
First Access database project for Advanced Java Topics

Vet Database Project (December 9, 2019)

For clarification about the client call: Your database must require a password to open. Also, there must be a splash screen (of sorts). This will typically include the app name and can also include the creator's name, a catch phrase or anything else that might catch the user's eye or give quick info. You can choose to either have it close with a timer or a button. Once the splash screen closes, immediately the Navigation Form should be open.

Partners: N/A

Other:
  - This was extremely early to complete!
  - The forms actually make this seems formal!
